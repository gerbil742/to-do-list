send a post request to the server with the id of the task we want to complete

set that task to being crossed off or shaded green

change it in the db to completed

have it so that the front end automatically displays compleded tasks to green

let users delete tasks completely. 

let users undo tasks after reclicking

have an external script file and we let on click listeners in JS?
  - change teh html on click and send a get request to teh server


Edit:

opens up a small window that lets you update the description and the due date for the todo

Learned that if the functions are in a separate script, then if i use a function in another script then the function wont be defined yet. 

sort by if completed first, and then by due date. things with no duedate are last? or first...



all thats left is making a sign in and doing error handling/validation
also can add a sort, a search
