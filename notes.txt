send a post request to the server with the id of the task we want to complete

set that task to being crossed off or shaded green

change it in the db to completed

have it so that the front end automatically displays compleded tasks to green

let users delete tasks completely. 

let users undo tasks after reclicking

have an external script file and we let on click listeners in JS?
  - change teh html on click and send a get request to teh server


Edit:

opens up a small window that lets you update the description and the due date for the todo

Learned that if the functions are in a separate script, then if i use a function in another script then the function wont be defined yet. 

sort by if completed first, and then by due date. things with no duedate are last? or first...



all thats left is making a sign in and doing error handling/validation
also can add a sort, a search

Errors
make it so we send back an error response if there is an error when querying teh data. these are all gonna be like mongodb errors i believe. 
we need to handle the error response in the front end as well. look at status code?

make an error page that shows "Something went wrong" and then the status code and teh message

error flow
front end (html) just needs to display whats given.
if given the data, then display it. if given the error, display a something went wrong instead
retreive teh entire body of the response

error handling in the front end should only be about if i dont get the data. otherwise, just display what we were sent in the res. 

send back the entire response in the http methods. we will always have a response since we have a default response in the server code. i believe

in the front end code. see if the response was good if it is process as normal, else process as an error. 

redo the html of the page in a JS script and display that using DOM. 

we also have a catch all 404 not found page
